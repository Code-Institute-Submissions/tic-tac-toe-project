# Tic Tac Toe

The rationale for this project was to create a fun Tic Tac Toe game, which runs in the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku.

Users will go up against the computer in a classical game of Tic-Tac-Toe.

The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.

If played optimally by both players, the game always ends in a tie, making tic-tac-toe a futile game that's been played and enjoyed for centuries.

Here is the live version of my project - [Tic Tac Toe]() 

# How to play 

You probably already know how to play Tic-Tac-Toe. It's a really simple game, right? That's what most people think. But if you really wrap your brain around it, you'll discover that Tic-Tac-Toe isn't quite as simple as you think!

Tic-Tac -Toe (along with a lot of other games) involves looking ahead and trying to figure out what the person playing against you might do next.

1. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.

2. You are X, your friend (or the computer in this case) is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.

3. The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.

4. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.

__Manual Testing__

I have manually tested this project throughout production and confirmed the following:
- Logic of game works.
- Necessary feedback is presented in a clear and engaging way.
- The get_user_move() input only accepts valid data, which is a number between 1 - 9.
- The play_again() input only accepts valid data, which is "yes" or "no"
